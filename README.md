# Meteorite Landings Visualization

This project provides a visual analysis of NASA's Meteorite Landings dataset, exploring the distribution, mass, and temporal trends of meteorite falls on Earth.

## Dataset Overview

- **Source**: [NASA Open Data Portal](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh)
- **Description**: Contains information on over 45,000 meteorites, including location, mass, composition, and year of fall.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Folium

## Visualizations

1. **Global Distribution Map**: Interactive map showing meteorite landing sites.
2. **Mass Distribution Histogram**: Histogram depicting the frequency of meteorites by mass.
3. **Temporal Analysis Line Chart**: Line chart illustrating the number of meteorite falls over time.

## How to Run This Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in sequence.
